# Karger-Min-cut-probelm
Algorithm for finding the min cut using Random Contraction

This program counts the minimun cut using the Random Contraction Algorithm.

The text file contains the adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph. There are 200 vertices
labeled 1 to 200. The first column in the file represents the vertex label, and the particular row (other entries except
the first column) tells all the vertices that the vertex is adjacent to. So for example, the 6th row looks
like : "6	155	56	52	120	......". This just means that the vertex with label 6 is adjacent to (i.e., shares an edge with)
the vertices with labels 155,56,52,120,......,etc

You need to run the program several times with different Random seed to get the correct answer.
